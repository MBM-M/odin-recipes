        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 ½ pounds boneless chicken thighs, cut into bite-size pieces</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, finely chopped</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons grated ginger</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon five-spice powder</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground white pepper, or to taste</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon rice vinegar</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
                <li>1 large egg</li>
                <li>1 cup tempura batter mix, dry, or as needed</li>
                <li>2 cups peanut oil for frying, or as needed</li>
                <li>1 bunch Thai basil, chopped</li>
                <li>2 green onions, chopped</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Mix chicken, garlic, soy sauce, ginger, five-spice powder, white pepper, salt, vinegar, and cayenne pepper together in a large bowl until well combined. Let marinate for 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Whisk egg in a small bowl until smooth. Place dry tempura mix into a second small bowl. Dip chicken pieces one at a time into egg, then dredge in tempura mix, shaking off any excess.</li>
                <li>Working in batches, lower chicken carefully into hot oil and fry until golden brown, 5 to 8 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain and season with salt and pepper.</li>
